# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project gives you basic idea behind how the path searching algorithms works in Graphs. I implemented 2 informed and 3 uninformed searches.

**Informed Searches** - algorithms who were informed where actually is the destination node.<br>
**Uninformed Searches** - Uses brute force techique to find the destination node.

## Algorithms Used in the Applications

- Dijkstra algorithm - uninformed search
- Breadth First Search - uninformed search
- Depth First Search - uninformed search
- Greedy Best First Search - informed search
- A\* Search - informed search

**Note** - Want to make things more interesting. Generate the different type of mazes in this application before visualizing the algorithm.

## Build Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwstyagi/visualizer-app.git
cd visualizer-app
npm install
npm start
```
